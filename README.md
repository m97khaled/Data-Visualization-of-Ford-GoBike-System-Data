# Data-Visualization-of-Ford-GoBike-System-Data
Applying practical data analysis process to communicate data insights

**This project is divided into two major parts.**

**1**
In the first part, I will conduct an exploratory data analysis on the dataset. I will implement Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships, but it does not need to be clean or perfect. This part of the project is where I will ask questions about the data and make discover it thoroughly. 

**2**
In the second part, I will take the main findings from the exploration phase and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. Finally, I will communicate the results through a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations in a story telling manner. This part of the project makes heavy use of the first part of the project.
